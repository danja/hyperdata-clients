I would like another codebase to use this as a lib and use it to call api clients. What does the developer of the other codebase need to know? Please render all information as complete, individual artifacts. Include mermaid diagrams and complete source code as appropriate, as individual, complete artifacts

---

Please create a unit test file for each source file under `src/common` targeting Jasmine and chai, these will go under `tests/unit`. Keep everything ES module style, follow best practices. Create mocks and helpers as necessary under `tests/helpers`. You will be tested on coverage using c8.

Please run the tests and repair as necessary. The source under test is working fine, so any breakage is down to the tests.
