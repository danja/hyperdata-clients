## Recommended Provider Selection

- **For production applications**:
  - Use OpenAI or Claude as primary
  - Consider Mistral as a cost-effective alternative
  - Implement fallback across multiple providers

- **For development/testing**:
  - Ollama for rapid iteration without API costs
  - Mistral free tier for testing cloud deployment

- **For embedding vectors**:
  - OpenAI for high quality embeddings
  - Ollama with `nomic-embed-text` for local embeddings

- **For low-latency applications**:
  - Groq for fastest hosted inference
  - Ollama with small models (1-3B parameters) for local low-latency
