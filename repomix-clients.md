File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
- Pay special attention to the Repository Description. These contain important context and guidelines specific to this project.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

================
File: .git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample
================
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches

# An example hook script to validate a patch (and/or patch series) before
# sending it via email.
#
# The hook should exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate
# message if it wants to prevent the email(s) from being sent.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "sendemail-validate".
#
# By default, it will only check that the patch(es) can be applied on top of
# the default upstream branch without conflicts in a secondary worktree. After
# validation (successful or not) of the last patch of a series, the worktree
# will be deleted.
#
# The following config variables can be set to change the default remote and
# remote ref that are used to apply the patches against:
#
#   sendemail.validateRemote (default: origin)
#   sendemail.validateRemoteRef (default: HEAD)

The minimal CLI here can be run as :

```sh
npm run ask [args]
```

or

```sh
node examples/minimal.js [args]
```

The _args_ are optional, where eg. :

```sh
npm run ask ollama --model 'qwen2:1.5b' 'how are you?'
```

- API is Ollama
- model is qwen2:1.5b
- prompt is "how are you?"

Internally a factory class `src/common/ClientFactory.js` is used to create an instance of a client for the specified API and model. This instance is then called with the prompt and whatever's returned is displayed.

Working hardcoded examples can be found in `examples/OllamaMinimal.js` and `examples/MistralMinimal.js`.

# Rate Limiting Implementations for AI Client Library

To help you avoid hitting API rate limits when using the AI Client Library, I've created three different rate limiting implementations, each suited for different use cases:

## 1. Basic Rate-Limited Client

A simple queue-based implementation that spaces requests evenly to stay within a requests-per-minute limit. Ideal for basic applications with moderate throughput needs.

## 2. Advanced Rate Limiter (Token Bucket)

A more sophisticated implementation using the token bucket algorithm, which allows for burst capacity while maintaining average rate limits. Includes provider-specific defaults and customization options.

## 3. Rate-Limited Batch Processor

A specialized utility for processing large batches of requests with features like concurrency control, automatic retries with exponential backoff, and progress tracking.

  apiKey: "your-api-key",
})

// Chat completion
const response = await client.chat([{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }])

// Stream response
await client.stream([{ role: "user", content: "Tell me a story" }], (chunk) =>
  console.log(chunk)
)
```

# hyperdata-clients

Yet another node API client library for interacting with AI providers using a common interface.

_I wanted my own so I knew how it worked_

```sh
npm run ask mistral 'In brief, how many AGIs will it take to change a lightbulb?'
...
Using API: mistral
Model: default
Prompt: In brief, how many AGIs will it take to change a lightbulb?
Using mistral key from: .env file

...it's uncertain how many would be needed to change a lightbulb...
```

## Status: 2025-04-13

Working for me against :

- Ollama (local)
- Mistral (free & speedy, needs API key)
- OpenAI (requires $s and API key)

Various other clients sketched out, will likely need tweaking.

Only tested on recent Ubuntu.

There's a very basic CLI for checking the thing (see below), also runnable hardcoded examples eg.

```sh
node examples/MistralMinimal.js
```

Jasmine tests currently all broken after an afternoon getting it to work...

## Features

- Support for multiple AI providers
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure API key management
- Consistent interface across providers
- Type definitions included
- Extensive test coverage

## Installation

Prequisites : recent node

```sh
git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-clients.git
cd hyperdata-clients
npm install
```

## CLI

Really minimal for testing purposes :

```bash
# Basic usage
npm run ask [provider] [options] "your prompt"

# or more directly
node examples/minimal.js [provider] [options] "your prompt"

# Mistral
npm run ask mistral --model 'open-codestral-mamba' 'tell me about yourself'

# Example with Ollama running locally, it'll default model to qwen2:1.5b
npm run ask ollama 'how are you?'

# requires an API key
node examples/minimal.js openai 'what are you?'
```
